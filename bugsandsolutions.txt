- Error:
    type string | null is not assignable to type string 
    in route.ts

    Happened because the first and lastname fields are supposed to return String but they're set to possibly return null. Something which is not
    allowed for strings, causing errors.

- Solution:
    - While there are many ways to solve this, either by making the last and firstname fields required, thus making them not possible to return null.
      I just used the non-null asertion operator to tell Typescript to esentially overlook it, as I'm sure the returining field won't be null.

    Went from this  

    const user = {
      firstName: first_name,
      lastName: last_name,
      username: username!,
      photo: image_url,
    };

    To this

    const user = {
      firstName: first_name!,
      lastName: last_name!,
      username: username!,
      photo: image_url,
    };

- Error:
  - User wasn't being created in MongoDB collection, even after successful signup.
      Essentially what happened was even when I was able to signup with a brand new email account and or unused Google account, the user profile wasn't being
      created in the cluster. When checking the Clerk dashboard the webhook was being found and attempted but would always end in failure.

- Solution:
  - Had to go to Vercel project deployment, go under Settings, then go under Deployment Protection and disable the top setting "Vercel Authentication".
    Redeployed app afterwards and double checked all environment variables were there.
