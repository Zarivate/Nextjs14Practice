- Error:
    type string | null is not assignable to type string 
    in route.ts

    Happened because the first and lastname fields are supposed to return String but they're set to possibly return null. Something which is not
    allowed for strings, causing errors.

- Solution:
    - While there are many ways to solve this, either by making the last and firstname fields required, thus making them not possible to return null.
      I just used the non-null asertion operator to tell Typescript to esentially overlook it, as I'm sure the returining field won't be null.

    Went from this  

    const user = {
      firstName: first_name,
      lastName: last_name,
      username: username!,
      photo: image_url,
    };

    To this

    const user = {
      firstName: first_name!,
      lastName: last_name!,
      username: username!,
      photo: image_url,
    };
